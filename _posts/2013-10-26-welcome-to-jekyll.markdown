As I was reading Marty Cagan's article, [The Power of Reference Customers][http://svcg.com] I couldn’t help but think of a small success we recently had with one of our customers.

Our customer wanted a novel and non-trivial feature added to our product. This feature was critical to their workflow and adoption of our product was contingent on our ability to deliver it. By working closely with the customer, WebFilings was able to deliver a solution they were extremely pleased with. A few things about the success of the project resonated with me. I think you might enjoy some of the leassons we learned.

1. The Importance of Platform and APIs
====
We were able to deliver the product quickly because most of the pieces were in place and abstracted into libraries or APIs. Only minor code changes to these libraries, along with some UI work, were required to realize the final product. For me this highlights the power of a well designed platform. One of the key componets to building a strong platform is a consistent API. 

2. The Importance of Speed and Urgency
====
We were able to get a version in our customer’s hands quickly by leveraging our lean practices and our product platform. I'm a huge fan of lean practices. At my current company we've created a culture built around empowering teams by giving them ownership and autonomy withing the organization. Our teams are extremely proud of their products and the impact they have on the customer. I've found that this added level of responsibility results in a healthy sense urgency within the team.

3. The Value of High Fidelity Prototypes
====
We were able to communicate and iterate on product vision with a high fidelity prototype. By iterating with the customer we ensured the team could provide a viable, technically feasible MVP within a reasonable timeframe. If a picture is worth a thousand words then a high fidelity prototype is worth a million. High fidelity prototypes are, without doubt, the best way to communicate your vision with your customer. 
 
4. The Value of MVP
====
This project was the first step toward delivering a comprehensive solution to our customers. Proving out the first piece gave our customer the confidence that we can deliver the next piece. It is important to agree upon an MVP with your customer as early as possible and stick to it. Throughout the project you will likely be tempted to sneak features in. Even if the features seem innocous, resist them.

I think there is a fundamental requirement to successfully execute on the points I've discussed above: a strong relationship with the customer. A strong relationship with the customer is vital to a company’s success. Strengthening relationships with the customer encourages engagement and results in more meaningful contributions to a product. While this idea seems like common sense, I've found that teams lose sight of these core principles if we don't remind ourselves often.
